  <h1>BPS Career Readiness: CTE and CFE</h1>
</div>
  <div class="col-8 col-s-9">
    <p class="intro-paragraph">Today's cutting-edge, rigorous and relevant career and technical education (CTE) programs prepare students for a wide range of high-wage, high-skill, high-demand careers. CTE students can earn industry certifications and licenses, gain career related work experience, take advantage of career focused leadership opportunities, and can compete in Career and Technical Student Organizations such as Robotics and DECA. CTE aims to prepare students to be college and career ready.  A wide variety of CTE programs are offered to BPS students in grades 9-12 including, but not limited to, IT, Engineering, Marketing, Architecture, and Mechatronics.
    <br></br>The goal of Career Focused Education (CFE) is to develop awareness of career pathways, amongst staff and students alike, at each building level: elementary, middle and high school. Examples of programs supporting CFE efforts are STEM education experiences, career fairs, industry and business leaders speaking to students in classrooms and our high school College and Career Centers, career and self-exploration with Xello, immersing teachers into local businesses to raise awareness of current industry trends, job shadowing, internships, and more.
    <br></br>Career Readiness is a critical part of a student's educational journey because it prepares students for life after high school as they move on to whatever their next steps are.  BPS aims to equip our students with the skills necessary to transition to a successful future.

                    business transactions, journalizing, posting, 8-column worksheet, financial statements and the closing
                    entries are covered. All work is completed electronically using accounting forms. This class utilizes 21st
                    century teaching techniques with interactive software and immediate feedback on their work. Accounting
                    principles, practices, procedures and theories are emphasized for a sound foundation to any student
                    wishing to pursue accounting at the university level or to help students become more marketable in todays
                    business environment. At the end of the trimester, an individual simulation will be completed that will tie all
                    units of study together. Accounting B is a continuation of the concepts taught in Introduction to Accounting A. Cash controls from
                    within the business and the services offered by banks to businesses are studied and practiced. Proof of
                    cash balances is emphasized. Payroll accounting will also be studied. All work is completed electronically
                    using accounting forms. This class utilizes 21st century teaching techniques with interactive software and
                    immediate feedback on their work. Students may also complete an extensive unit of accounting applications
                    in the field of tax accounting. Upon the completion of Introduction to Accounting A and Accounting B, a
                    student should have acquired the basic knowledge of how accounting works and functions. At the end of
                    the trimester, an individual simulation will be completed that will tie all units of study together. A student
                    should also have sufficient skills for an entry-level job or an excellent head start in the study of accounting
                    in a post high school situation.</p>

                and entertainment industries. Students will learn techniques and practices used to make this global market
                part of a multi-billion dollar per year industry. Strategies used by successful sports and entertainment
                marketing and management firms and businesses will be evaluated.
                Sports and Entertainment Marketing will prepare students for advanced studies in marketing/management
                and create an inside look at how and why the sports and entertainment industry operates.
                Much of this course's work will be accomplished with student teams. Student teams will own their own NFL
                (National Football League) franchise and participate in a Seaholm Fantasy Football League. Students will
                research and make marketing and management decisions that will affect their individual teams (i.e. Location
                of the franchise, team logos, team colors, team mascot, team nicknames, etc.).
                Other areas of sports and entertainment marketing and management that will be investigated will be
                professional sports promotions, NCAA non-revenue sports promotions, marketing history of professional
                sports, sports drink sponsorship, and the movie/concert industry.</p>

                placement, audio, and design techniques. You will use a classroom intranet web server to practice posting
                your web sites. Classmates will offer structured critiques to improve your web skills. We all use the Internet
                every day- find out how it works! Some students have taken this class and gone on to create professional
                web pages in a business setting or as entrepreneurs. If this area is of interest to you, consider also signing
                up for Web Design B and Programming A. Completion of Web Design A could lead to college advanced
                placement credit. In Web Design B, you will take your web design skills to the next level by designing web sites that are exciting and innovative. You

                your PhotoShop and DreamWeaver skills, and use Adobe Illustrator and Animate. Make and add your own

                class to use for college, job applications, and/or scholarship requests.
                You will use a classroom intranet web server to team and work with other students when creating some of
                the websites in class. This prepares you for work in college and in the real world. You have the freedom
                to use your computer knowledge and web design expertise to develop a web site on a topic of your
                choice! If this area is of interest to you, consider also signing up for Programming A and/or AP Computer
                Science Principles (1 and 2).</p>
